## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an undergrad student passionate about **quantum mechanics**, **mathematical physics**, and **scientific computing**. Currently, Iâ€™m focusing on **phase space quantum mechanics** and exploring its connections with quantum optics.

### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on
- Phase space quantum mechanics on different symmetry groups.
- Using **Julia**, **Python**, and **Mathematica** for symbolic and numerical simulations in theoretical physics.

### ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning
- Group-theoretical methods on quantum mechanics and representation theory.
- Tools for high-performance computing in physics research.

### ðŸ“« How to reach me
- Feel free to reach out via [email](mailto:rodrigo.aceves5762@alumnos.udg.mx).
